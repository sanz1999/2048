# 2048
Popular game, 2048, I made it in highschool while I was trying to learn C programming language.

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.

I made it using two matrix 4x4, I used one matrix for display to player. 
Second matrix is used to move numbers upon pressing commands, merging same numbers and generating new number on the oposite direction of what player pressed.
It very easy and basic game to make, but developing my own way to make it work was truly enjoyable.

My next goal for this game is to make graphic and UI for it. I still can't decide do I want to use OPEN GL or maybe to make it as WPF application.
